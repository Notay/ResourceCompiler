# ResourceCompiler

Generates resource satellite assemblies from raw resource files *.txt *.restext *.resx. 
Also generates a library with default embedded resources, and helper classes to reference with your .Net applcation.

Supports resource sources is sperate folders or a long-side the compiled resource files.

Designed to work with .Net 4.0, will likely work on anything newer.

Requires Windows SDK for .Net 4.0 installed in program files (x86). Should already have it if you have Visual Studio 2015, if not get it from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279
